# function is just a set of algorithms that are executed when the function is called.

m1=input("enter your first num : ")
m2=input("enter your second num : ")

#to create a function we use the expression "def" and the name of the function that you want to have
def addnum():
    print(float(m1)+float(m2))#instructions inside the function

addnum()#this is how the function is called
